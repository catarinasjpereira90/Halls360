# Halls rebranding 
360ยบ EDIT Disruptive Digital Education project

This project was created by a multidisciplinary team of Digital Marketing, UXUI and Front-end development.
Halls rebranding was meant to reach Millenials by associating it identity to focusing and achievement of daily life goals. 

Although there's a desktop version, this microsite is built focusing mainly in mobile using.
While presenting the project we gave the audience the opportunity of interacting. Access was given by QR Code. 
Insert the Code BBBB and see how many "Cravas" you would get.

Front-end development team: 
Catarina Pereira and Sofia Nunes.
